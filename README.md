aNDI is (to be) a collection of NDI utilities (for Android devices).  

In the future I wish to make this cross-platform, but I'm a bad programmer and don't know how to efficiently decode video frames and get more than 2fps :(((  

EDIT 6th November 2021; huh so suddenly it's operating at like 20fps...!?


Anyway yeah, work in progress!
