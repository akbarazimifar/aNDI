> Read more: https://featherbear.cc/blog/post/andi-ndi-tools-for-android/

aNDI is a collection of NDI utilities (for Android devices).  
In the future I wish to make this cross-platform, but I'm a bad programmer and don't know how to efficiently decode video frames and get more than 2fps :(((  
Anyway yeah, work in progress!

* [flutter-ndi](https://github.com/featherbear/flutter-ndi) - Follow the instructions to get the NDI SDK and library files.
